# IEEE-Project-Agribot
This IEEE project involves development of a chat-bot for agriculture which can assist farmers.
Initial phase involves:
Andorid app development
Disease detection in crops
Weed detection in crops

# Resources 

* Google Doc Link :- [Leaf Detection IEEE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nCRV0rKZPA8pAbzRU6rEWbEFcS2zgqy8VJRXBMh19io/edit)

  This docs file has the links to the datasets found for leaf detection. It also contains details about different leaf diseases.
